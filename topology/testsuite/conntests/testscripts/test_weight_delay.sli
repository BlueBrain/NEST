% this tests checks if weights and delays can be set to
% arbitrary values within the limits set by resolution
%
% It creates a grid with a single row and uses linear functions for weights and delays
% Expected weights are 1., 0.98, 0.96, 0.94, 0.92, 0.90, 0.88, 0.86, 0.84, 0.82
% Expected delays with resolution 0.04 are 1.0 0.96 0.96 0.92 0.92 0.88 0.84
