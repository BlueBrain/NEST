% to be run before run_test.sli

% Circular mask, radius 0.25
%
% Setup:
%     - 5x5 -> 5x5, extent 1.25x1.25
%     - nodes "freely placed" at regular grid locations
% expectation:
%   /anchor [ -0.25 0.0 ] : right edge of mask aligned with source
%
%   each node is connected to
%     - the node in the same location in the target layer
%     - two nodes to the left of that location
%     - the two nodes to the left and above and below that location
%     - should give identical results to reg_mask_circ_anchor_01.sli
%
%   nodes at the edges have no connections beyond the edge
%
