%   The fictional point (5,5) measured from the top-left corner of the mask towards
%   the bottom right is aligned with each source, i.e., the top left corner of the mask
%   displaced by (-5,-5) relative to the source node, measured in grid coordinates.
%   With a grid origin at (0,0), the "last" node in the 5x5 grid is at (4,4). For
%   connections from this node, the box upper left corner of the 2x3 mask is placed
%   at (-1,-1) and spans to (0,1), i.e., it contains nodes only at (0,0) and (0,1).
