% to be run before run_test.sli

%  Setup:
%  - 5x5 -> 5x5, extent 1.25x1.25 ->
%  - nodes "freely placed" at regular grid locations
%  - rectangular mask ll: [0.,0.] ur: [0.6,0.3]
%  - anchor [-0.5,-0.25]
%  - should give identical results to reg_mask_rect_01.sli

% loop y-coords backwards so that we get same gid-pos mapping as on grid
