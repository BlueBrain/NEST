% to be run before run_test.sli

%  Setup:
%  - 5x5 -> 5x5, extent 1.25x1.25 -> -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5
%  - rectangular mask ll: [0.,0.] ur: [0.6,0.3]
%  - anchor [-0.5, -0.25]
%
%  Expectation:
%  - anchor moves rectangle to lower left of source
%  - for source 14 [0.0,0.0] box-ll at [-0.5,-0.25], ie 5, ie T:31
%  - for source 14, box-ur at [0.1, 0.05], ie top-right of 14, ie T:40
%
%   nodes in the bottom row connect only to nodes on the corresponding row
%   nodes at the right edge have no connections beyond the edge
