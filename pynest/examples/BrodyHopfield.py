# This script reproduces the spike synchronization
# behavior of integrate-and-fire neurons in response to a subthreshold
# oscillation. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 1 of

#   C.D. Brody and J.J. Hopfield
#   Simple Networks for Spike-Timing-Based Computation,
#   with Application to Olfactory Processing
#   Neuron 37, 843-852 (2003)

# Neurons receive a weak 35Hz oscillation, a gaussian noise current
# and an increasing DC. The time-locking capability is shown to
# depend on the input current given. The result is then plotted using pylab.
# All parameters are taken from the above paper.
#
# units are the usual NEST units: pA,pF,ms,mV,Hz
