Event interference during spike delivery.

This test demonstrates that if the send() method of a Connection
manipulates the multiplicity of the Event object that is used
for all spike deliveries during a call to Scheduler::deliver_events(),
errors results, as this changed multiplicity will affect all 
subsequent deliveries during the same time step.

See also #426.

This test requires static_synapse_mult0 from developer.
