This is the README file for NEST's testsuite.

When writing tests, please adhere to the following guideline:

 * The test scripts in selftests and mpitests have to be written in
   SLI, as they test for basic functionality, which has to be checked
   on the lowest level.

 * The tests in unittests and regressiontests may be written in either
   Python or SLI. They are executed by the right executable according
   to their filename extension.

 * Tests that are written in Python are run after the SLI tests.

 * Tests that need models which depend on the GSL need to be protected
   by a check like this, which should be above all actual code in the
   test script:

   % This test should only run if we have GSL
   statusdict/have_gsl :: not {statusdict/exitcodes/success :: quit_i} if

 * Tests that need threading, need to be protected by a check like
   this, which should be above all actual code in the test script:

   statusdict/threading :: (no) eq {statusdict/exitcodes/success :: quit_i} if
